    <h3>Place of deers</h3>
    <p>Mazatlán is a Nahuatl word meaning "place of deers". The city was founded in 1531 by an army of Spaniards and indigenous
    people.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The mid-19th century, a large group of immigrants arrived from Germany. Over time, Mazatlán developed into a
    commercial seaport, importing equipment for the nearby gold and silver mines. It served as the capital of Sinaloa from
    1859 to 1873.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The German settlers also influenced the local music, banda, with some genres being an alteration of
    Bavarian folk music. The settlers also established the Pacifico Brewery on March 14, 1900.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> With a population of 438,434 (city) and 489,987 (municipality) as of the 2010 census, Mazatlán is the second-largest
    city in the state. It is also a popular tourist destination, with its beaches lined with resort hotels.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> A car ferry crosses the Gulf of California, from Mazatlán to La Paz, Baja California Sur. The municipality has a land area of
    3,068.48 km2 (1,184.75 sq mi) and includes smaller outlying communities such as Villa Unión, La Noria, El Quelite, and
    El Habal. Mazatlán is served by General Rafael Buelna International Airport.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h3>The Malecón</h3>
    <p>The Malecón (boardwalk) of Mazatlán is to be considered one of the longest in the world. Its length is about 8.5 km along
    the Pacific coast. Along the Malecón are high cliffs, monuments, roundabouts, historical buildings, hotels, etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The Malecón is composed of a series of roadways with designated space for pedestrians. The names of these roads vary
    depending on the stage or time of their construction.

    <br>
    <p>From south to north, the roads that compose the Malecón are as
    follow:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><em>Calz. Joel Montes Camarena:</em> which connects the lighthouse, which used to be an island, to the rest of the city.
    Paseo del Centenario: starting in the previous street and bordering the west at the lookout hill where cliffs are seen,
    it was built to commemorate the centennial of the Independence of Mexico.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><em>Paseo Olas Altas:</em> the oldest section of the boardwalk, it was originally a dike to prevent flooding problems in the
    1830s, then it became an embankment which was used as urban space, and eventually it became a recreational space. It was
    the first part of the city with street lighting, and includes the south side of icebox hill and lookout hill.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><em>Paseo Claussen:</em> it was built for the centennial in 1910. It borders the icebox hill and ends at the bay of Puerto Viejo.
    It was named in honor of George Claussen, who was in command of the Mazatlán Works Agency and promoted the centennial
    project.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><em>Avenida del Mar:</em> this is the most representative and longest section of the boardwalk; it extends along the bay of
    Puerto Viejo and comprises just over half of all the boardwalk. The panoramic tour ends at the tip, which initiates the
    Golden Zone (the primary hotel zone), and the avenue changes names twice and continues for several kilometers parallel
    to the coastline, yet maintains some distance from the coastal hotels.</p>
